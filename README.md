Cellular Signal Strength Map, which is formally known as The Radio Wave Detector, is an application designed to survey the signal strength at different location and display a signal strength map with color coordinated dots. To use this application, a user has to move around with this application opened, and then the application will show the signal strength at the user's past locations.
